          A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are
          linked together using cryptography. It's also described as a
          "trustless and fully decentralized peer-to-peer immutable data
          storage" that is spread over a network of participants often referred
          to as nodes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous
          block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a
          Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed
          when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks
          each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a
          chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it.
          Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data
          because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered
          retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

          Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as
          a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a
          protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. Although blockchain
          records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be
          considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing
          system with high Byzantine fault tolerance

          The blockchain was popularized by a person (or group of people) using
          the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction
          ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, based on work by Stuart Haber,
          W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto
          remains unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin
          made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending
          problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The
          bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that
          are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies.
          The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail. Private
          blockchains have been proposed for business use but Computerworld
          called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper
          security model "snake oil". However, others have argued that
          permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more
          decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than
          permissionless ones.
